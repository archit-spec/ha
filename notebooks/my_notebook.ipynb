    "      \"response\": \"<Thought>\\nAlright, I need to find the total sum when I cube each integer from 5 to 35 and add them together, then cube each integer from -5 to -35 and add them together, and finally sum those two results. Let's break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let's understand what cubing integers means. Cubing a number involves multiplying it by itself twice. So, for example, \\\\(5^3 = 5 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 5 = 125\\\\).\\n\\nNow, the first part of the problem is to cube each integer from 5 to 35 and add them together. This can be represented as:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=5}^{35} k^3\\n\\\\]\\nSimilarly, the second part is to cube each integer from -5 to -35 and add them together:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=-5}^{-35} k^3\\n\\\\]\\nFinally, we need to add these two sums together to get the total result.\\n\\nLet me think about how to approach calculating these sums. One way is to calculate each term individually and then add them up, but that would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to simplify this process.\\n\\nI recall that the sum of cubes from 1 to n is given by:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\left( \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\right)^2\\n\\\\]\\nBut wait, our range starts at 5, not 1. So I'll need to adjust this formula accordingly.\\n\\nFirst, let's find the sum of cubes from 1 to 35 and subtract the sum of cubes from 1 to 4 to exclude the numbers below 5:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{35} k^3 - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{4} k^3 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{35 \\\\times 36}{2} \\\\right)^2 - \\\\left( \\\\frac{4 \\\\times 5}{2} \\\\right)^2\\n\\\\]\\nCalculating these:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\left( \\\\frac{1260}{2} \\\\right)^2 - \\\\left( \\\\frac{20}{2} \\\\right)^2 = 630^2 - 10^2 = 396,900 - 100 = 396,800\\n\\\\]\\nSo, the sum of cubes from 5 to 35 is 396,800.\\n\\nNext, let's consider the sum of cubes from -5 to -35. Cubing a negative number yields a negative result, so:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=-5}^{-35} k^3 = -\\\\sum_{k=5}^{35} k^3 = -396,800\\n\\\\]\\nNow, adding the two sums together:\\n\\\\[\\n396,800 + (-396,800) = 0\\n\\\\]\\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Did I make a mistake?\\n\\nLet me double-check my calculations. The sum of cubes from 5 to 35 is indeed 396,800. The sum from -5 to -35 is the negative of that, which is -396,800. Adding them together gives zero. But intuitively, since we're adding positive and negative cubes that are symmetric around zero, their sum should cancel out, resulting in zero.\\n\\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify with smaller numbers. For example, if I take k = 1 to 3:\\n\\\\[\\n1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36\\n\\\\]\\nAnd from -1 to -3:\\n\\\\[\\n(-1)^3 + (-2)^3 + (-3)^3 = -1 -8 -27 = -36\\n\\\\]\\nAdding them together: \\\\(36 + (-36) = 0\\\\). This confirms that the sums cancel each other out.\\n\\nTherefore, the total sum when you cube each integer from 5 to 35 and add them together, then cube each integer from -5 to -35 and add them together, and then sum those two results is zero.\\n</Thought>\\n\\n<Output>\\n0\\n</Output>\",\n",
